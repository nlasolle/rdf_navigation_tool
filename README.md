# System description
This system has been designed to find interesting resources by exploiting similarities between
elements of an rdf graph. A resource can be anything such as an art work,
a document, a place, an individual, etc. The results found using the tools
are exposed through a chronological-based interface in which one can navigate
through results.

First designed for the Henri Poincar√© correspondence corpus,
this system can be reused with any corpora as long as corpus data is available
through a sparql endpoint.
